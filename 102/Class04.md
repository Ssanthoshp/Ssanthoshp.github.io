# Structure web pages with HTML

## What is HTML and why do we use it?

+ HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
+ HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
+ HTML describes the structure of a Web page
+ HTML consists of a series of elements
+ HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
+ HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

Using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you're looking at.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

< p > My cat is very grumpy< / p >

+ Openning tagname '< p >' 

+ Content 'My cat is very grumpy'

+ Closing tagname ' < / p > '

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

'< h1 > My First Heading < /h1 >'

'< p > My First Paragraph< /p >''
