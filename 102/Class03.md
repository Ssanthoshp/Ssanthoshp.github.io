# Practice with Git

>#### **GitHub** offers a unique, user-friendly interface that allows a novice coder to take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, it would take more technical knowledge and use of the command line. The “**Git**” implies the version control system; a tool that allows  to keep track of the constant revisions to the code. The “**Hub**” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code.


## Version Control
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

## What is cloning in Git?
By cloning the file, we can copy all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

## What is the command to track and stage files?
The '*git status*' command is used to track the status of Git repository, showing the current branch and the status of files (untracked, modified, or deleted). '*git add*' command is used to stage files.

## What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
The *git stash* and *git commit* commands are similar in that both take a snapshot of modified files in the git working tree and store that snapshot for future reference. 

## What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
*git push* is the command that will send your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.
