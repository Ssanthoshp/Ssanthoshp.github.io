# Practice with Git

>#### **GitHub** offers a unique, user-friendly interface that allows a novice coder to take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, it would take more technical knowledge and use of the command line. The “**Git**” implies the version control system; a tool that allows  to keep track of the constant revisions to the code. The “**Hub**” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code.
