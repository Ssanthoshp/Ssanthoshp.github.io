# Programming with JavaScript

## What is control flow?
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

## What is a JavaScript function?

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

### Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

Automatically (self invoked)

You will learn a lot more about function invocation in this [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)


## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

The () operator invokes (calls) the function:

In JavaScript, parentheses () are used when defining a function to declare the function parameters, which represent the inputs that the function expects to receive when it is called.

Example:

greet('John');

In this example, 'John' is an argument passed to the greet function when it is called. The function will then use this value as the name parameter inside its body.
