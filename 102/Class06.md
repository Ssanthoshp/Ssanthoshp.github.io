## What are variables in JavaScript?
Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

* Automatically
* Using var
* Using let
* Using const

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

Declaring variables is one of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript. Variables are used to store and manage data in your programs. To declare a variable means to create a named placeholder for data that you want to use later.

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

The assignment ( = ) operator is used to assign a value to a variable or property. The assignment expression itself has a value, which is the assigned value.


## What is information received from the user called?

In JavaScript, we use the prompt() function to ask the user for input. As a parameter, we input the text we want to display to the user. Once the user presses “ok,” the input value is returned. We typically store user input in a variable so that we can use the information in our program.
