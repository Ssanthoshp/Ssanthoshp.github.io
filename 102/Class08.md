# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value. The computation is called an evaluation. For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50: 5 * 10.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false .

## When does a for loop stop executing?

If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. 

## How many times will a while loop execute?

A while loop will execute an indeterminate number of times as long as the condition is true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will exit and the program will continue to execute the code after the loop.
