## Text editor vs Coding-specific Text Editor vs IDE
### Text Editor
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### Coding Specific Text Editor
Code-specific text editors has built-in features like it has syntax highlighting and code completion, as well as word completion and function completion. 

**Example** 

> ***Visual Studio Code*** is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft. It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the web developing community.

### IDE
An **IDE** '(Integrated Development Environment)' is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If youâ€™ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package.

### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

- code completion
- syntax highlighting 
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

### What do the following commands do?

**pwd:** it tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.

**ls:** This command tells us what is the content of the directory we are currently in.

**cd:** This command allows to change directory and move to a different place.

**mkdir:** This command helps to make a new directory.

**touch:** This helps to create a file that doesn't have a directory and to change the file's timestamp.
 
### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
- cd projects : Moving to projects directory
- mkdir new-project: Making a new directory by the name new-project.
- touch new-project/newfile.md: Creating a new file named newfile.md inside new-project directory.
- cd ..: Going back to the projects directory.
- ls projects/new-project:  It shows the list of files and directories created in new-project.
